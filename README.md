## Overview
In this tutorial, we'll extend the concepts covered in a prior tutorial, accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovO1NpAMAEk&t=11s). While the previous tutorial focused only on text input and just basic QA, this one shows you how to get the token count from the query that you want to send to the model. We'll be making design adjustments and updating the code available in this [repository](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/TextOnlyGeminiApp/tree/main).
